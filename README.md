### Hello - I'm Landon! I am a Christian first, a husband second, a learner third, and a technology nerd fourth.

#### What am I currently working on?
I am a full-time iOS developer at Vermont Information Processing (VIP) in Colchester, Vermont. VIP develops software for the beverage industry, helping sales reps, delivery drivers, and more keep track of their inventory, sales, and other company information.

#### What am I learning?
I am currently focusing on improving my communication skills (which I see as equally important to development skills).

As an iOS developer, I am always honing my programming skills in Swift and Objective-C, version control with Git, and the Xcode IDE. Other areas in tech which interest me include user experience (UX) design, mindful technology use, and artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.

#### Where do I want to go next?
I am always looking to learn. I need to be challenged to grow, and will jump at any opportunity to do so. Contact me via [email](mailto:landon.cayia@gmail.com) if you want to get to know me.

#### What do I enjoy outside of work?
- Reading (my favorite genres include theology, politics, personal finance, technology, mystery, thriller, and crime)
- Spending time outside (walking, hiking, and cycling)
- Listening to classical music and (also somewhat classical) podcasts
- Apple products (the elegance of its hardware and software, not the company itself)
- Daydreaming about being able to do my job without looking at a screen all day (a man can dream, right?)
